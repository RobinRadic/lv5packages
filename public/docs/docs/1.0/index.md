#### Hows that working?
- No database required, just a webhost and PHP.
- Powered by the [Laravel 5](http://laravel.com) framework with a bunch of useful vendor or self made packages.
- Theming done by [Laradic Themes](https://github.com/laradic/themes) providing inherited, cascading multi-theme support.
- Uses my well-documented, feature rich and simply awesome [Packadic](https://github.com/packadic/theme) theme as default.
- Multiple storage engines. Setting up a project can be as easy as pointing to a github repository!
